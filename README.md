## Borrowed Harmonious Concepts

* Ethical
* Design-Driven
* Upstream-First
* Full-Stack

## Beliefs

We believe in these ideas. We aren't absolutists about any of them.

### Ethical

* Everyone - We want to support everyone, in many languages, with diverse users and contributors.
* Open - Open protocols, open formats, open data, open models, open weights, open source.
* Private - User data belongs to the user. Encryption helps prove safety.
* Verified Trust - Promises aren't worth anything. We provide evidence.

### Design Driven

* Simple - The hardest part of good design is cutting through the clutter.
* Less - We strive to know when a system is sufficient.
* AI Last - We aren't anti-AI, but it should always be optional.
* Immutable - Uncontrolled state mutation is the source of most software bugs.

### Upstream First

* Cooperative - We work with other people who share our beliefs. They don't have to share all of them.
* Everywhere - We have preferred platforms but we don't reject any distribution model.
* Secure - Adversarial Security survives regime changes. The supply chain will be compromised.
* Recurring Revenue - Ops and support were always what customers paid for. We sell support, not IP.

### Full Stack

* Vertical Integration - IoT, kernel, drivers, toolkits, apps, web, services, cloud, and beyond.
* Distributed Computing - Most computers are distributed now.
* Ultra Copyleft - Most applications are network applications now. We prefer the AGPL-3.0.
* Local First - Users deserve to have their data close to them.
